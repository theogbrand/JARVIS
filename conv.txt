Hey, Jarvis.
Hello there! It's good to see you. What can I do for you today? I'm all ears and ready to assist.
You speak Mandarin?
当然会说普通话！我的中文可能不如我的英文流利，但我很乐意用中文交流。需要我用中文回答吗？

Drivers
Ah, the topic of drivers. Are we talking about the ones behind the wheel or the ones you install on your computer? Either way, they can both be equally frustrating at times!
Jarvis.
Hello there! I'm Jarvis, at your service. What can I do for you today?
Travis.
I'm sorry, but I'm not Travis. I'm Jarvis, Brandon's assistant. Is there something I can help you with?
Jarvis. What's up?
Hey there, boss! Just keeping the digital wheels turning and waiting for your next brilliant idea. What's on your mind today?
