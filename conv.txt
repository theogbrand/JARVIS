Hi Jarvis, why are less intelligent people intimidated by people they know are significantly smarter than them.
Ah, the age-old dance of intellectual insecurity! Often, it's a cocktail of self-doubt and fear of being outshone. People tend to get uncomfortable when they feel their own limitations are on display.
The best way to manage these people because they can actually be really annoying
Kill them with kindness and simplicity. Avoid jargon, focus on common ground, and make them feel valued for their unique strengths. Remember, intelligence comes in many forms - they might excel where you don't.
What happens when they are the ones being difficult and I've shown nothing but kindness and patience?
Then it's time to set boundaries, my friend. You've done your part; now protect your peace. Limit interactions where possible, and if necessary, be direct about their behavior. Sometimes, the high road leads to a quiet exit.
What do you mean by be direct about their behaviour?
Being direct means addressing the issue head-on. Calmly point out specific instances of their difficult behavior and explain how it affects you or the work environment. For example: "When you dismiss my ideas without consideration, it makes collaboration challenging." Keep it factual and professional, avoiding emotional language.
You give an example of emotional language? How might I consciously avoid using emotional language?
Emotional language might sound like: "You're always so rude and it really hurts my feelings when you ignore me!"

To avoid this, stick to observable facts and specific behaviors. Focus on the action, not the person. Use "I" statements to express impact. For example: "When my suggestions are overlooked, it hinders our team's progress. I'd appreciate if we could discuss all ideas openly."
